# Seokhyun Yoon - Data Analyst Portfolio

## 👋 About Me

Hello, I'm Seokhyun Yoon — a Statistics graduate from Simon Fraser University with a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and business intelligence tools.

I’ve developed hands-on projects applying predictive modeling, time series analysis, and classification algorithms to real-world problems such as rainfall forecasting, housing price prediction, and rocket landing success rates.

I work primarily with **Python, R, SQL, Power BI, Tableau**, and version control tools like Git. I enjoy simplifying complex data into actionable insights and visual stories that help people make better decisions.

This repository showcases selected projects reflecting my technical skill set and ability to turn raw data into practical outcomes.

## 📊 Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction Dashboard

This project simulates a full analytics pipeline to analyze customer churn behavior using OLAP-style exploration, predictive modeling with PyTorch, and an interactive Tableau dashboard.

---

### 🚀 Overview

This project aims to identify key drivers of customer churn in a telecom company and provide business-friendly insights using statistical analysis and machine learning. The project demonstrates:

- Data cleaning and warehouse-style dimensional modeling  
- OLAP exploration (churn rates by contract, internet service, tenure, etc.)  
- Predictive churn classification using a neural network (PyTorch)  
- Key KPIs and trends visualized using Tableau  

---

### 🧰 Tools Used

- **Python** (pandas, PyTorch, scikit-learn, SMOTE)  
- **Tableau Public** for dashboards  
- **GitHub** for version control and documentation  

---

### 🔍 OLAP-Style Exploration Highlights

- **Churn Rate by Contract Type**  
  Compared churn rates across `Month-to-month`, `One year`, and `Two year` contracts.  
  → Found that short-term (Month-to-month) customers churned the most.

- **Churn by Internet Service**  
  Analyzed churn by service type: `DSL`, `Fiber optic`, or `No internet`.  
  → Fiber optic users had the highest churn rate.

- **Churn by Tenure Group**  
  Created tenure buckets: `0–12m`, `13–24m`, `25–48m`, `49–72m`.  
  → Longer-tenure customers churned significantly less.

- **Monthly Charges Bucket Analysis**  
  Grouped customers into pricing tiers: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`.  
  → Higher monthly charges correlated with higher churn.

---

### 🤖 Predictive Modeling

The churn classification model was built in PyTorch and achieved:

- **Accuracy:** ~79%  
- **F1-score for churners:** ~0.58  
- Applied class imbalance handling using SMOTE and weighted loss

---

### 📈 Tableau Dashboard

The dashboard summarizes churn performance and customer segmentation using KPI cards and bar charts.

| KPI: Churn Rate | Churn by Internet Service |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| ![KPI Churn](images/telco5.png) | ![Internet Type](images/telco2.png) |

| Churn by Gender | Churn by Contract Type |
