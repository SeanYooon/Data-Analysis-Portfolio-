## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage Landing Prediction
**Code:** 
- [Coursera Study Project Notebook](https://github.com/DoubleOne7/coursera/blob/main/coursera-study-project.ipynb)
- [Folium Interactive Map Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/DoubleOne7/coursera/blob/main/lab_jupyter_launch_site_location%20%282%29.ipynb)



**Goal:** Develop machine learning algorithms for predicting the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage.

**Description:** This capstone project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land after launch. The successful landing of the first stage is crucial for reducing launch expenses and determining the overall cost-effectiveness of space missions. By accurately predicting landing outcomes, this project aims to provide valuable insights into launch cost estimation, influencing decision-making processes for companies entering the competitive space exploration market.

**Skills:** request api, data cleaning, Interactive map, data wrangling, data visualization, data analysis, correlation matrix

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SQL, bs4, Folium

**Results:** Through Python functions, comprehensive data analysis, visualization, and machine learning model development were conducted, resulting in a robust predictive model capable of accurately forecasting Falcon 9 first stage landing outcomes.


###  Housing price prediction

**Goal:** To make a best prediciton for the close test housing data set.

**Code:** [`Tech Store Sales Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Tech%20Store%20Sales%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Description:** This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict the sale price (in USD) of residential properties in Connecticut, based on sales data encompassing 995,644 properties sold between 2019 and 2020. The dataset includes properties sold for less than $10,000,000. The training set constitutes 20% of the data, while the private leaderboard comprises 50% of the testing set. Covariates such as List_Year indicate the year of property listing, and Date_Recorded denotes the completion date of the sale. Additionally, the Address covariate contains the street name of the property, with street numbers suppressed.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, data imputation, meachine learning

**Technology:** R, tidyverse, glmnet, Xgboost

**Results:** Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques like XGBoost in R, we can create a sophisticated predictive model for housing prices. By incorporating feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble methods, we can enhance the model's accuracy and robustness, providing accurate predictions for housing prices with high precision and flair. 


### Nashville Housing Data Cleaning
**Code:** [`Data Cleaning Project Queries: Nashville Housing.sql`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20Project%20Queries:%20Nashville%20Housing.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of houses that have been sold in Nashville between 2013 and 2019. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing.


**Skills:** DML(Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DDL (Data Definition Language).

**Technology:** SQL Server


### Covid 19 Data Exploration
**Code:** [`COVID Portfolio Project.sql`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/COVID%20Portfolio%20Project.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types
