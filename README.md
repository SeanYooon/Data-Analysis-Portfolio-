# Seokhyun Yoon - Data Analyst Portfolio

## üëã About Me

Hello, I'm Seokhyun Yoon ‚Äî a Statistics graduate from Simon Fraser University with a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and business intelligence tools.

I‚Äôve developed hands-on projects applying predictive modeling, time series analysis, and classification algorithms to real-world problems such as rainfall forecasting, housing price prediction, and rocket landing success rates.

I work primarily with **Python, R, SQL, Power BI, Tableau**, and version control tools like Git. I enjoy simplifying complex data into actionable insights and visual stories that help people make better decisions.

This repository showcases selected projects that reflect my technical skill set and my ability to turn raw data into practical outcomes.

### üöÄ SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction

**Code:**  
- [`Study Notebook`](https://github.com/DoubleOne7/coursera/blob/main/coursera-study-project.ipynb)  
- [`Folium Interactive Map`](https://nbviewer.org/github/DoubleOne7/coursera/blob/main/lab_jupyter_launch_site_location%20%282%29.ipynb)  

**Report:**  
- [`spacex-final.pdf`](https://github.com/DoubleOne7/coursera/blob/main/spacex-final.pdf)

**Goal:** Predict whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land after launch.

**Description:** Applied machine learning to model landing outcomes for SpaceX rockets. This project aimed to help reduce costs and improve decision-making in commercial space launches.

**Skills:** API requests, data cleaning, mapping, visualization, correlation analysis  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SQL, BeautifulSoup, Folium

**Results:** Built a robust ML model using classification techniques that accurately predicted landing outcomes.

### üè† Housing Price Prediction

**Code:**  
- [`Housing-price-prediction.Rmd`](https://github.com/DoubleOne7/Housing-prediciton-project/blob/main/Housing-price-prediction.Rmd)

**Goal:** Predict real estate prices in Connecticut using advanced machine learning models.

**Description:** Built a regression model on 995,000+ housing records from 2019‚Äì2020 to predict sale prices. Emphasized data cleaning, feature engineering, and model tuning.

**Skills:** Data wrangling, imputation, modeling, EDA  
**Tech Stack:** R, tidyverse, glmnet, XGBoost

**Results:** Achieved strong model performance using XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning and robust feature selection.

---

### üöì Police Complaints Prediction

**Code:**  
- [`Final_Version.R`](https://github.com/jasondang01/440module2-jason-tyler-sean/blob/main/Final_Version.R)

**Goal:** Predict which CPD officers would receive complaints in 2015‚Äì2016 using data from 2000‚Äì2014.

**Description:** Modeled officer misconduct likelihood based on salary, prior complaints, and service data. Explored fairness and ethical data analysis.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, feature engineering, classification, ROC analysis  
**Tech Stack:** R, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, randomForest, XGBoost, pROC

**Results:** Built accurate classifiers using Random Forest and XGBoost. Evaluated models with AUC and ROC metrics.

### üåßÔ∏è Rainfall Time Series Forecasting

**Code:**  
- [`Rainfall Final.Rmd`](https://github.com/bba32/stat485/blob/main/Rainfall%20Final.Rmd)

**Report:**  
- [`Project Report (PDF)`](https://github.com/DoubleOne7/Data-Analysis-Portfolio-/blob/main/485%20Project%20Report%20Official.pdf)

**Goal:** Forecast monthly rainfall in Perth, Australia using time series techniques.

**Description:** Analyzed decades of rainfall data to build ARIMA-based forecasts. Focused on seasonal trends and long-term planning implications.

**Skills:** Time series modeling, residual diagnostics, visualization, forecasting  
**Tech Stack:** R, dplyr, tidyr, TSA, forecast

**Results:** Selected and validated ARIMA models using MAE and RMSE metrics. Delivered 12-month forecasts with 95% prediction intervals.
